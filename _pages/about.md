Hello! I'm John Song, a Master's graduate in Information Science with two years of research experience in bioinformatics. I've developed a Java-based Bayesian Network Model for flu diagnosis and contributed to projects involving AI and machine learning, including prompt design for large language models and pathology image analysis using pre-trained models. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs and making personalized AI healthcare assistants accessible to everyone. I'm now applying for a PhD in Computer Science to further this vision.

##### My Journey
- **Bayesian Network Modeling in Java**
Developed a user-friendly package implementing a Bayesian Network Model for flu disease diagnosis. This tool assists healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses by analyzing complex data patterns.

- **Large Language Models for Healthcare**
Provided code support for projects utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to design prompts for flu disease diagnosis. This work pushes the boundaries of how AI can interpret and generate human-like text to aid in medical assessments.

- **Pathology Image Analysis with Pre-trained Models**
Contributed to pathology projects by supporting code development for analyzing whole slide images using the pre-trained model Prov-Gigapath. This enhances the ability to perform downstream tasks like detecting anomalies in medical images.

- **Data Preprocessing and Management**
As a research assistant in the bioinformatics department, I handled preprocessing of unstructured data (text, whole slide images) and tabular data (CSV files), efficiently uploading and organizing them into SQL databases.

##### My Vision
- I'm a firm believer that AI has the power to revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs and making personalized AI healthcare assistants accessible to everyone. By democratizing medical knowledge, we can empower individuals and make quality healthcare a universal reality.

##### What's Next?
- I'm currently applying for a PhD in Computer Science or Bioinformatics to further my research in AI-driven healthcare solutions. My goal is to continue pushing the envelope in AI, machine learning, and large language models to create innovative tools that benefit everyone.
