#### 1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge in probabilistic formalisms.
In the field of transfer learning, which is a sub-area of machine learning, these differences between settings are referred to as heterogeneity. Unlike traditional machine learning, transfer learning explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, from which we develop a model M that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, for which we use or adapt M, often because the target setting has insufficient data to develop a model de novo. Researchers distinguish transfer learning algorithms by what kinds of heterogeneous transfer learning scenarios (or simply heterogeneous scenarios) they can handle.

This project created the Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN-TL) algorithm to re-use of source model, such as  influenza,  learned from electronic medical record (EMR) data to predict the target data set. (for more info see: *Transfer Learning For Bayesian Case Detection Systems*)



#### 2. Quick Start
*If you have not install JAVA JDK 18 or 1.8 yet, please install first*

4. Run
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/6.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/7.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

#### 3. Run your own models

##### 3.1 Prepare input folder
- data must be in .arff format.
- model must be in .bif, .xml, .xdsl format.

###### 3.1.1 structure of input folder
    folder_name
        utility
            your configurationFile.txt
        sourceData
            sourceData.arff
        sourceModel
            source_learn_model.bif (you could put multi-models)
        targetData
            target_test_data.arff
            target_train_data.arff
        targetModel
        result
            intermediate folder-->to store result.
        log

###### 3.1.2 parameters for configurationFile.txt

```


- run unadjust & ratio performance, you need to have Source Part, Target Part, Feature Part, and Path part.
- Run KL options, you need to have KL Part that includes in configuration file.
- For multi-source processing,
```
sourceLearnedModelName= 1.bif,2.bif,...
sourceDataSize=1661,1661...
```

#### 4. Weighted & Multi-Sources
##### 4.1 Weighted (unadjusted & Ratio)
Searching model process is led by a score. The score is the sum of log marginal likelihood and log structure prior
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


###### 4.1.1 Unadjusted Approach
Use sample size of the source training data.
###### 4.1.2 Ratio Approach
Use sample size of the target training data.  

Number of target instances / number of source training instances

Weight the source sample size based on the similarity between the target distribution and the source distribution. â€¯If the source and the target distributions are very different, it would be better to assign a lower equivalent sample size for a transferred source model.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


##### 4.2 Multi-Sources  

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
